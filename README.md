Hey I'm David Lerner and I'm a self taught programmer. I'm currently working on building up my portfolio as well as my skills. My current projects are primarily in JS and Python. I love the endless journey in the world of coding and I've got big plans. Currently working as a freelancer on Upwork. Hit me up if you would like to collaborate on something, I'm always looking to learn something.
