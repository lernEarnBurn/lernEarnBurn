Hello, my name is David Lerner, and I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for coding. I have a diverse range of skills that enable me to take on a variety of programming projects. I specialize in Python, which I use for data analysis and web scraping. I am also proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which I use for web development projects.

I have experience developing web applications using popular frameworks such as React and Angular. I enjoy solving complex problems and building user-friendly interfaces that are intuitive to navigate. I also have experience in web scraping, which has allowed me to extract data from various websites for analysis and visualization.

As a programmer, I am constantly learning and keeping up with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. I am a detail-oriented individual who takes pride in delivering high-quality work. Whether it's developing a new application or improving an existing one, I approach every project with enthusiasm and a desire to succeed.
